Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111 = (1*2^2) + (1*2^1) + (1*2^0) = 7
100 = (1*2^2) + (0*2^1) + (0*2^0) = 4
10110 = (1*2^4) + (0*2^3) + (1*2^2) + (1*2^1) + (0*2^0) = 22

2. The available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number is 2^8
   Which is 256 but we start to count from 0 so the range is 255.

3. A method that could represent a negative numbers between 0-255 Given a 9 bits binary number
   is to designate the leftmost bit as the sign bit.

   If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive.
   If the sign bit is 1, the number is negative.
   If the number is negative, take the one's complement of the remaining 8 bits.
   For example:
   Let's say we have the 9-bit binary number 110110011:
   The leftmost bit is 1, indicating that it's a negative number.
   To find the magnitude, take the one's complement of the remaining 8 bits:
   Invert all the bits (change 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s): 001001100.
   Now, convert the magnitude (001001100) to decimal: 36.

   Since the sign bit is 1, the overall value is -36.
