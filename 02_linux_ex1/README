Kernel System Calls
-------------------
< Your Answer >

# execve("/usr/bin/ls", ["ls", "-li", "whatIdo"],
system call that executes the program /usr/bin/ls with the arguments ["ls", "-li", "whatIdo"]

# newfstatat(1, "", {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(0x88, 0), ...}, AT_EMPTY_PATH) = 0

The newfstatat system call is used to retrieve information about a file, such as its size, mode, link count, and access time, in a buffer
It is similar to the stat and lstat system calls, but it allows the file to be specified relative to a directory file descriptor instead of the current working directory

###whatIdo it creating folder with name welcomeToDevOpsJan22 and inside file named goodLuck with text inside "There you go... tell me what I do..."


Binary Numbers
--------------
< Your Answer >
#1.Convert the following binary numbers to a decimals: 111, 100, 10110

111=7
100=4
10110=22

#2.What is the available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number?

in range of smallest value 00000000 and largest value 11111111 or (8+16+32+64+128)=256

#3.Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent a negative numbers between 0-255

1. start with absolute value of number (255 in our case or 1111 1111)
2. inverting all the 1 to 0 (0000 0000)
3. adding 1 to the entire inverted number will give us representation of -255
3.1 binary representing of the numbers in 4bit system
binary  decimal
  0000        0
  0010        2
  1010       -2
  1101       -5
  1000       -0

4. Suggest a method to represent a floating point numbers (e.g. 12.3, 15.67, 0.231) using a 8 bits binary numbers

12.3 = 00001100.0100110011....
1.1000100110011...*2"8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
0000 1100

0.3 * 2 = 0.6 (0)
0.6 * 2 = 1.2 (1)
0.2 * 2 = 0.4 (0)
0.4 * 2 = 0.8 (0)
0.8 * 2 = 1.6 (1)
06 * 2 = 1.2 (1)
...

Explicit Normalization
12.3 = 0.123 = bin 1.111011
