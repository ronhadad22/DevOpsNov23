Kernel System Calls
-------------------
//The stat system call is used to retrieve the meta data of the file
stat("./welcomeToDevOpsJan22", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0

//The getrandom system call is used to generate random numbers for more secure way to obtain high quality numbers directly from the kernel
stat("./welcomeToDevOpsJan22", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0

//The openat system call is used to open files or create file descriptors so we can see there's a file called "welcomeToDevOpsJan22/goodLuck" when i ran strace.
openat(AT_FDCWD, "welcomeToDevOpsJan22/goodLuck", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

//The write system call is used to write data to files or devices
write(3, "There you go... tell me what I d"..., 36) = 36

//And once we are done, the close system call followed by exit group system call are exiting the program with a return code of 0 because it went successfully
close(3)                                = 0
+++ exited with 0 +++

So first of all i ran sudo chmod u+x on the file so we can execute it and then
the program created a new directory (welcomeToDevOpsJan22) which contain a file called (goodLuck) and in the text file it says "There you go... Tell me what i do"

Binary Numbers
--------------
1.צפיתי בסרטון הזה כדי להבין איך לחשב:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLflTjd3lWA&ab_channel=TheOrganicChemistryTutor

111 in binary equals to 7 in decimal
100 in binary equals to 4 in decimal
10110 in binary equals to 22 in decimal

2.The range is from 0 to 2^8 - 1 = 0 to 255

3.
For negative numbers (-1 to -256): Use Two's complement representation.
Start with the positive binary representation of the number.
Invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
Add 1 to the inverted binary number.

For example:
Binary representation of 5 positive : 00000101
Then we invert the bits and get the following: 11111010
And then add 1 to the inverted binary number: 11111011
So now the 9-bit two complement method representation of -5 is 11111011.

4.
I used the following format to understand how to calculate
SIIII.FFFF
S is the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative).
IIII is the 4-bit integer part.
FFFF is the 4-bit fractional part.

Now if we represent the decimal number 12.75:
Convert the integer part (12) to binary: 1100
Then convert the fractional part (0.75) to binary: 0.11 (75% of 1)
Then combine the integer and fractional parts: 1100.11
And then Adjust to the 8bit format: 01100.1100
so now in an 8bit representation 12.75 would be 01100.1100

And thank god to the internet and calculators....
