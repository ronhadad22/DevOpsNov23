2.the method to represent a negative numbers between 0 and 255 is : 
Designating the leftmost bit as the sign bit.
If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive.
If the sign bit is 1, the number is negative.
For negative numbers, invert all the bits and add 1 to the result.

3.A method that represents a floating point numbers using a 8 bits binary numbers :
-----------------
To represent 12.3:

Integer part: 12 (represented as 1100 in 4 bits)
Fractional part: 0.3 (0011 in 4 bits, as 0.3 in binary is 0.010011)
Combined: 1100.0011
To represent 15.67:
-----------------
Integer part: 15 (represented as 1111 in 4 bits)
Fractional part: 0.67 (1011 in 4 bits, as 0.67 in binary is 0.1011)
Combined: 1111.1011
To represent 0.231:
------------------
Integer part: 0 (represented as 0000 in 4 bits)
Fractional part: 0.231 (0010 in 4 bits, as 0.231 in binary is 0.0010)
Combined: 0000.0010
------------------
binary numbers 

The decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number is 2*8
Which is 256 but the range is 0 to 255 

4.
*2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0
*2^2 = 1 * 4 = 4
*2^1 = 1 * 2 = 2
*2^0 = 1 * 1 = 1
*4 + 2 + 1 = 7
--------------- 
* 2^2 = 1 * 4 = 4
* 2^1 = 0 * 2 = 0
* 2^0 = 0 * 1 = 0
* 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
----------------
* 2^4 = 1 * 16 = 16
* 2^3 = 0 * 8 = 0
* 2^2 = 1 * 4 = 4
* 2^1 = 1 * 2 = 2
* 2^0 = 0 * 1 = 0
* 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22
