Kernel System Calls
-------------------
< Your Answer >
The program whatIdo do follow things:
1) system call openat:
   open or create if not exists a file /welcomeToDevOpsJan22/goodLuck
   within a current working directory for writing only.
   If the file already exists, it's truncated to zero length.
   The file is given read-write permissions for owner,group and others (0666)
   the system call returns file descriptor of new created/updated file
2) system call write:
  String of characters "There you go... tell me what I d" with a length of 36 bytes
  is written to the  goodLuck
3) the file is closed
4) the program exit with code 0 - means successful


Binary Numbers
--------------
< Your Answer >
1.
111 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1+2+4= 7
100 = 0+0+2^2=4
10110 = 0+ 2^1 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^4 = 2+4+16=22

2.What is the available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number?
0 to 2^8 - 1 = 0-255 (11111111 = 2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7=1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128=255

3.Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent a negative numbers between 0-255
 8 bits for representation a number between 0 to 255, 9th bit (MSB) = for representation a sign: 1 for "-", 0 for "+"

4. Suggest a method to represent a floating point numbers (e.g. 12.3, 15.67, 0.231) using a 8 bits binary numbers
 Exponent (4 bits),  Fraction (4 bits)
 1100.0101 = 2^3+2^2+(2^-2)+(2^-4) = 8+4+1/4+1/16==12+0.3=12.3
 1111.1011 = 2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0+(2^-1)+(2^-3)+(2^-4) = 8+4+2+1+0.5+0.12+0.0625=15.68
 00.001111 = 0+(2^-3)+(2^-4)+(2^-5)+(2^-6)=0+0.125+0.0625+0.03125+0.015625=0.234
