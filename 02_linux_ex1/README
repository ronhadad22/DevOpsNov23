Kernel System Calls
-------------------

whatido file does call on a few system calls like mmap which maps
the partition of a file into memory of the process or write() which is used to modify files. 
By the strace command, I can guess that the script is checking if a "welcomeToDevOpsJan22" folder is existing
and if not creates it and creates a files with text "There you go.. Tell me what I do"




Binary Numbers

1.  111 - 7 
    100 - 4
    10110 - 22

2. The highest decimal range represented in 8 bits are 256
   The ranges starts at 0 - 255 (256) value is 255 = 11111111 
   
3.  For this I would suggest to use MSB, we can represent integers from the range of 
    -256 to 256 using this method, MSB can be 0 for positive and 1 for negative. 
    For a positive 9-bit number with a leading 0, 42 would be 001010101
    To present a negative number we have to invert all the bit 
     42 = 001010101
    -42 = 110101010 
    Then we have to add 1, meaning -42 really equals 110101011
    
    

4.  Seperate them into seperate numbers, the full number can be presented in Binary.
    the remaining can
